# Step 8: Build Single-File Executable - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully updated the build script and created a single-file executable for NullInstallerEnhanced.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated build_modern.bat
- Modified the `.NET SDK` build section to use `dotnet publish` instead of `dotnet build`
- Added single-file publishing parameters:
  - `/p:PublishSingleFile=true` - Creates a single executable file
  - `/p:IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract=true` - Includes all dependencies
  - `-r win-x64` - Targets Windows x64 runtime
  
### 2. Added Project Configuration
The following properties were added to the dynamically generated `.csproj` file:
```xml
<PublishSingleFile>true</PublishSingleFile>
<SelfContained>true</SelfContained>
<RuntimeIdentifier>win-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
<IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract>true</IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract>
```

### 3. Code Signing Support (Optional)
- Added automatic detection for `signtool`
- Attempts to sign the executable with available certificates
- Uses DigiCert timestamp server for timestamping
- Gracefully skips if no certificate is available

### 4. Output Handling
- Automatically renames output from `NullInstaller.exe` to `NullInstallerEnhanced.exe`
- Places final executable in `dist\` directory

## Build Results

### Executable Created
- **Location**: `dist\NullInstallerEnhanced.exe`
- **Size**: ~108 MB (self-contained with .NET runtime)
- **Type**: Single-file, self-extracting executable
- **Target**: Windows x64

### Build Warnings (Non-critical)
1. `WebClient` obsolete warning - legacy code using WebClient instead of HttpClient
2. Unused field warning for `currentProgress` - minor code cleanup opportunity

## Verification Steps Completed
✅ build_modern.bat updated with single-file publish command
✅ Project file configuration includes all required properties
✅ Code signing support added (optional)
✅ Executable successfully created at dist\NullInstallerEnhanced.exe
✅ Build process tested and working

## Command to Build
```batch
./build_modern.bat
```
Or:
```batch
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract=true -o dist NullInstaller.csproj
```

## Next Steps (if needed)
- The executable is ready for distribution
- Can be signed with a code certificate if available
- Ready for deployment and installation testing

## Notes
- The executable is self-contained and includes the .NET runtime
- No additional dependencies required on target machines
- The large file size (~108 MB) is due to the embedded .NET runtime
