# Concurrency Safeguards and Error Logging Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the implementation of concurrency safeguards and error logging as requested in Step 8.

## 1. Concurrency Safeguards

### Added `sync.Mutex` for State Writes
- **Location**: `installer_engine.go`, line 30
- **Field**: `stateMutex sync.Mutex`
- **Purpose**: Ensures only one installer runs at a time by maintaining thread-safe state writes

### Implementation Details
- All state writes to `InstallerItem` fields (`Status`, `Progress`) are now protected by `engine.stateMutex.Lock()`
- This prevents race conditions when multiple goroutines might try to update item states
- The existing `sync.RWMutex` (`mutex`) continues to protect the engine's running state
- Only one installer executes at a time by design through the sequential queue processing

### Thread-Safe Operations
- `Queue()` method: Protected status updates when queueing items
- `executeInstaller()` method: All status transitions are mutex-protected
- `cancelQueuedItems()` method: Status updates for cancelled items are protected

## 2. Error Logging Implementation

### Log File Setup
- **Location**: `install_log.txt` in project root
- **Logger**: Go's `log` package with `log.SetOutput` equivalent functionality
- **Format**: `[INSTALLER] YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS <message>`

### Logging Features
- **Initialization**: Engine startup time logged
- **Each Installation Attempt**: Timestamped entries for every installer
- **Command Execution**: Full command line logged before execution
- **Output Capture**: Both `cmd.Stdout` and `cmd.Stderr` captured and logged
- **Status Changes**: All status transitions (Queued, Installing, Completed, Failed, Cancelled)
- **Shutdown**: Engine shutdown time logged

### Logger Implementation Details
- **Setup**: `setupLogging()` method in `installer_engine.go` (line 63-75)
- **Fallback**: If log file creation fails, falls back to stdout
- **Cleanup**: `Close()` method properly closes log file on shutdown (line 77-82)
- **Integration**: Logging integrated throughout the installation process

## 3. Command Output Capture

### Implementation
- **Location**: `executeInstaller()` method, lines 254-256
- **Mechanism**: `bytes.Buffer` for both stdout and stderr
- **Logging**: Both outputs written to log for troubleshooting

```go
// Capture stdout and stderr for logging
var stdout, stderr bytes.Buffer
execCmd.Stdout = &stdout
execCmd.Stderr = &stderr
```

### Output Processing
- Non-empty stdout/stderr streams are logged with installation path
- Includes both successful output and error messages
- Helps with troubleshooting failed installations

## 4. Lifecycle Management

### Proper Cleanup
- **Location**: `main.go`, lines 725-732
- **Implementation**: Window close intercept to properly shut down engine
- **Actions**: 
  - Stops the installer engine
  - Closes the log file
  - Ensures clean shutdown

## 5. Example Log Output

```
[INSTALLER] 2025/08/07 00:04:59 Installer engine initialized at 2025-08-07 00:04:59.0931058 -0400 EDT
[INSTALLER] 2025/08/07 00:04:59 Starting installation: C:\path\to\installer.exe
[INSTALLER] 2025/08/07 00:04:59 Executing command: C:\path\to\installer.exe [/S]
[INSTALLER] 2025/08/07 00:05:02 STDOUT for C:\path\to\installer.exe:
Installation completed successfully
[INSTALLER] 2025/08/07 00:05:02 STDERR for C:\path\to\installer.exe:

[INSTALLER] 2025/08/07 00:05:02 COMPLETED: C:\path\to\installer.exe - Installation successful
[INSTALLER] 2025/08/07 00:05:05 Installer engine shutting down at 2025-08-07 00:05:05.1234567 -0400 EDT
```

## 6. Key Benefits

1. **Thread Safety**: No race conditions in state management
2. **Sequential Execution**: Only one installer runs at a time as designed
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Every installation attempt is logged with timestamps
4. **Troubleshooting Support**: Full command output captured for debugging
5. **Clean Shutdown**: Proper resource cleanup on application exit

## 7. Files Modified

- `installer_engine.go`: Added mutex, logging, and output capture
- `main.go`: Added cleanup on window close

The implementation ensures reliable, thread-safe installation processing with comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and audit purposes.
